SECTION 2: MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS (2015-2024)
Biology – Frequently Asked Questions
• How does the SA node regulate the heartbeat? (NEET 2015, 2017, 2020, 2023)
The sinoatrial (SA) node, located in the right atrium, is the heart’s natural pacemaker. It generates electrical impulses that spread through the atria, causing contraction. These impulses then reach the atrioventricular (AV) node, travel down the Bundle of His, and stimulate the ventricles. The SA node sets the rhythm of the heartbeat, controlled by autonomic nerves.

• What is the function of HCl in the stomach? (NEET 2016, 2019, 2022)
Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach serves multiple functions:

It activates pepsinogen into pepsin, which digests proteins.
It provides an acidic environment (pH ~1.5-3.5) for enzymatic activity.
It kills harmful bacteria and prevents infections.
It facilitates the breakdown of food and absorption of certain nutrients.
• Compare innate and acquired immunity. (NEET 2017, 2018, 2021)

Innate immunity is non-specific and present from birth, providing the first line of defense (e.g., skin, mucous membranes, phagocytes).
Acquired immunity is specific and develops after exposure to pathogens, involving antibodies and memory cells. Acquired immunity can be:
Active (via vaccination or infection)
Passive (transfer of antibodies from mother to child)
• What is the role of tRNA in protein synthesis? (NEET 2015, 2018, 2020)
Transfer RNA (tRNA) acts as an adapter molecule in translation. It carries specific amino acids to the ribosome, matching its anticodon with the codon on mRNA. This ensures the correct sequence of amino acids in the growing polypeptide chain. Each tRNA has an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that charges it with the appropriate amino acid.

• Describe the PCR process in biotechnology. (NEET 2016, 2019, 2022, 2024)
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a technique used to amplify DNA sequences. Steps:

Denaturation (~95°C): DNA strands separate.
Annealing (~50-65°C): Primers bind to complementary DNA sequences.
Extension (~72°C): Taq polymerase synthesizes new DNA strands.
This cycle is repeated multiple times, exponentially increasing the DNA amount.
Chemistry – Frequently Asked Questions
• Explain the concept of Gibbs Free Energy. (NEET 2015, 2018, 2020, 2023)
Gibbs Free Energy (G) determines the spontaneity of a reaction using the equation:
ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

If ΔG < 0, the reaction is spontaneous.
If ΔG > 0, the reaction is non-spontaneous.
If ΔG = 0, the system is at equilibrium.
Temperature and entropy changes influence Gibbs energy.
• Derive the Nernst Equation for electrochemical cells. (NEET 2016, 2019, 2022)
The Nernst equation calculates cell potential under non-standard conditions:
E = E° - (0.0591/n) log [Products]/[Reactants]
Where:

E = Cell potential
E° = Standard cell potential
n = Number of electrons transferred
[ ] = Concentrations of species involved
This equation accounts for ion concentration changes affecting electrochemical reactions.
• Compare SN1 and SN2 reaction mechanisms. (NEET 2017, 2019, 2021, 2024)

SN1 (Unimolecular Nucleophilic Substitution):
Occurs in two steps via carbocation intermediate.
Rate depends only on the substrate.
Favored in tertiary alkyl halides.
SN2 (Bimolecular Nucleophilic Substitution):
Occurs in one step via backside attack.
Rate depends on both substrate and nucleophile.
Favored in primary alkyl halides.
• What is the hybridization of SF₆ and PCl₅? (NEET 2015, 2018, 2020, 2023)

SF₆ (Sulfur hexafluoride): Undergoes sp³d² hybridization, forming an octahedral structure.
PCl₅ (Phosphorus pentachloride): Undergoes sp³d hybridization, forming a trigonal bipyramidal structure.
• Explain Aldol Condensation with an example. (NEET 2016, 2019, 2022)
Aldol condensation involves the formation of β-hydroxy aldehyde or ketone from an enolate ion and carbonyl compounds.
Example: Acetaldehyde undergoes aldol condensation to form 3-hydroxybutanal, which dehydrates to crotonaldehyde.

Physics – Frequently Asked Questions
• Derive KE = ½ mv² using the Work-Energy Theorem. (NEET 2015, 2018, 2020, 2023)
The work-energy theorem states that work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy:
W = ΔKE = KE₂ - KE₁
Since initial KE is zero (at rest):
W = ½ mv² - 0
⇒ KE = ½ mv²

• State and explain Lenz’s Law. (NEET 2017, 2019, 2021, 2024)
Lenz's Law states that an induced current always opposes the change in magnetic flux. It ensures conservation of energy in electromagnetic induction.
