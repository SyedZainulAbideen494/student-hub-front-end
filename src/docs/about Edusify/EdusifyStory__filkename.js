        {/* Introduction */}
        <h2 className="storySectionTitle__filkename">The Vision â€“ Why Edusify Was Created</h2>
        <p className="storyText__filkename">
          **Not every study app is made equal.**  
          Some are clunky. Some are outdated. And most? Just distractions.  
        </p>
        <p className="storyText__filkename">
          Edusify was built differently. A **high-end, AI-powered study app**  
          designed for students who **take their future seriously**.  
        </p>
        <p className="storyText__filkename">
          This isnâ€™t just another tool.  
          Itâ€™s the **Apple of study apps**â€”crafted for those who demand the best.

          From a small room in **Bangalore**, I designed, coded, and perfected  
          every detail. **Every line of code, every UI animation, every AI algorithm**â€”  
          all made by me.  
        </p>
