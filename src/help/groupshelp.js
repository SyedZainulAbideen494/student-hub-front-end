                <li>Select whether the group is <strong>Public</strong> or <strong>Private</strong>. If you check the box, the group will be public; otherwise, it will remain private.</li>

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the user is already in the group, they will not receive an invitation.</li>
            <li>If the user does not have an Edusify account, you won't be able to invite them.</li>
            <li>If the group is private and you are not the admin, you cannot invite users.</li>
