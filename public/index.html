          <h2>Founder of Edusify: Syed Zain-ul-Abideen</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Syed Zain-ul-Abideen</strong>, born on <strong>January 12, 2007</strong>, is the 18-year-old self-taught coder and entrepreneur behind Edusify. Based in Bangalore, India, Zain built Edusify at the age of 17 with a clear goal: to simplify student life using the power of artificial intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without formal coding education, he learned 8 programming languages independently and developed the first version of Edusify in just two weeks. His father was the first investor in the startup, supporting Zain’s vision and giving him the initial boost needed to take Edusify public.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Zain leads a team dedicated to changing how students learn—with elegance, intelligence, and purpose.
